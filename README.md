Credit card fraud detection:

As the dataset is imbalanced to balance it undersampling and oversampling was done.
Acquired 99% accuracy on using Random Forest Classifier on oversampled dataset.
The random forest classifier model was saved used jobfile library so make easier predictions


Spam mail prediction:

Implemented Tfifvectorizer to convert text data(mail data) into numerical values. 
Achieved an accuracy of 97% on using SVM


MovieGenre-classification:

implemented tf-idfvectorizer and also used nltk and also stopwords and also stemming process 
is done.and also used naive bayes classifier,decisiontree classifier,svc classifier,
logistic regression and maximized the accuracy levels of the model.


customer-churn prediction:
Build a model (ANN) in tensorflow/keras and generated the model with accuracy of upto 86%
